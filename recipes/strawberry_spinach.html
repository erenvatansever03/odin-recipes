    <h1>Strawberry Spinach Salad</h1>
    <img src="photos/spinach.jpg">
    <p> This strawberry spinach salad is a great way to get kids to eat spinach! Someone brought this salad to a potluck dinner, and I had to have the recipe. Since then, I've made it many times and I've been asked for the recipe every time I take it somewhere.</p>
